I am a Master's student in Computer Science at [York University](https://www.yorku.ca), specializing in **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Information Visualization (Vis)**. My research is focused on applying natural language processing techniques to information visualization to further enhance the comprehensibility and accessibility of visualizations, i.e., charts, graphs, etc. 

Part of my role as a Master's student is being a **Teaching Assistant** for the **EECS 1022: Object Oriented Programming**, and a **Research Assistant**, working in NLP with Vis. Outside of the university work, I am also actively participating in collaborative research works, focusing on the evaluation of **Large Language Models** in both **multi-lingual** and **multi-modal** domains. In my leisure, I like to read books, play video games, and cook &#128516;.
